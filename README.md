# Air-soft shop

Right now I've only developed the login page, but no worry I'm working on it.

## Description:

This is an E-commerce for an airsoft shop where you can buy ASG(air-soft guns).
I've only used html, JS and CSS for the development.

## How to start the dev server:

First of all you need to clone the repository on your machine then:

### 1° method: Using VSC extension

- Install the VScode extension "Live Server" => (extensionId: ritwickdey.LiveServer)
- Click the "Go live" button in the bottom right corner of the IDE;
  <!-- FIXME: This process is broken -->

### 2° method: Directly open from browser

- drag the "login-page.html" page file inside the tab of a browser

## How it works:

- You'll first be redirected to the login page;
- insert your credentials (right now it just works since we haven't implemented the validation yet);
- TODO: ... (still in development) ...
