# Air-soft shop

Right now I've only developed the login page, but no worry I'm working on it.

## Description:

This is an E-commerce for an airsoft shop where you can buy ASG(air-soft guns).
I've only used html, JS and CSS for the development.

## Instruction:

- Clone the repo on locale;
- Open the "login-page.html" page on a browser (it should be in the air-soft shop.JS directory);
- Install the VScode extension live Server, enable it and start the server, after that you will need to press on the link for the login-page;

## How it works:

- You'll first be redirected to the login page;
- insert your credentials (right now it just works since we haven't implemented the validation yet);
- TODO: ... (still in development) ...
