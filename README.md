# Air-soft shop

Right now I've only developed the login page, but no worry I'm working on it.

## Description:

This is an E-commerce for an airsoft shop where you can buy ASG(air-soft guns).
I've only used html, JS and CSS for the development.

## How to start the dev server:

First of all you need to clone the repository on your machine then:

### 1° method: Using VSC extension

Install the VScode extension "Live Server" => (extensionId: ritwickdey.LiveServer).
after the installation you have few option for starting the local server:

- Click the "Go live" button in the bottom right corner of the IDE;
- Right click on a HTML file from Explorer Window and click on Open with Live Server.
- Open a HTML file and right-click on the editor and click on Open with Live Server.
- Hit (alt+L, alt+O) to Open the Server and (alt+L, alt+C) to Stop the server (You can change the shortcut form keybinding). [On MAC, cmd+L, cmd+O and cmd+L, cmd+C].
- Open the Command Palette by pressing F1 or ctrl+shift+P and type "Live Server: Open With Live Server" to start a server or type "Live Server: Stop Live Server" to stop a server.

### 2° method: Directly open from browser

- drag the "login-page.html" page file inside the tab of a browser

## How it works:

- You'll first be redirected to the login page;
- insert your credentials (right now it just works since we haven't implemented the validation yet);
- TODO: ... (still in development) ...
